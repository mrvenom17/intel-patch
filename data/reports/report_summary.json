    "raw_response": "Title: Critical Vulnerability in Sendmail's Debug Mode - Root Access Allowed to Attackers\n\nDescription: The debug command in the Sendmail software has been found to be vulnerable. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands as root, which is the most privileged user account on a Linux system. This can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.\n\nSeverity: Critical (CVSS Score: 10.0)\n\nPublication Date: October 1st, 1988\n\nThis vulnerability is quite old, but it's important to note that any systems still using this version of Sendmail with the debug mode enabled are at significant risk and should be updated immediately. The use of a firewall and other security measures can also help mitigate some of the risks associated with this vulnerability."

    "raw_response": "Title: Urgent Security Advisory: Critical Vulnerability in Legacy Sendmail Version (1988) - Root Access Allowed to Attackers\n\nDescription: A critical vulnerability has been discovered in the debug command of a legacy version of the Sendmail software, dating back to 1988. This vulnerability allows unauthorized attackers with network access to execute arbitrary commands as root, which could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches on affected systems.\n\nSeverity: Critical (CVSS Score: 10.0)\n\nPublication Date: October 1st, 1988\n\nAlthough this vulnerability has been known for decades, it is crucial to highlight that any systems still using this outdated version of Sendmail with the debug mode enabled remain at a substantial risk and should be upgraded immediately. Implementing additional security measures such as firewalls, access controls, and regular system updates can help mitigate some associated risks.\n\nIt is essential for system administrators to be aware that the use of legacy software may expose their systems to known vulnerabilities, even if they have not been actively exploited. This serves as a reminder to always prioritize security best practices when managing technology infrastructure and staying updated on the latest threats and mitigation strategies."
